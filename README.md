# meet-the-researcher

This site has two purposes:

1. To display my research and academic career
2. Show the rapid advancements and capabilities of AI.

The idea was to see how far one can go by editing a single HTML file for creating a researcher CV page. The answer was quite far! Up to 6 hour version basically no knowledge of coding and very little knowledge about design was required. The "≈10 hours of work" version required some understanding of coding. The final version is the best I can do in a reasonable time frame. The AI used was `01-preview` from OpenAI.

See if you can spot the differences between versions!

## The final version (After ≈17 hours of work)

- A lot of final polishing done by hand.
- Development time would probably be 2 hours left, if I would have not decided to try fix "one more thing" while very tired.
- Problems with hallucination started to occur roughly after 1000 lines.
- Wanted this to be copy-pastable as plain html, so that added complexity.
- Most of the additional time compared to "≈10 hours"-version went went in little things.
  - Scrolling issues on phones were a pain.

## After ≈10 hours of work

- Mostly AI-made code, minor adjustements done by human.
- Presentable and usable (almost) as is.

## After 6 hours of work

- All major features done by AI
- Minor adjustements to css (e.g. animation timing) done by human.
  - Majority of the styling was still done by the AI.

## After 4-hours of work

- Fully AI-generated.
- Quite impressive result given the time frame.
