# meet-the-researcher
This site has two purposes:

1. To display my research and academic career
2. Show the rapid advancements and capabilities of AI.

The idea was to see how far one can go by editing a single HTML file for creating a researcher CV page. The answer was quite far! Up to 6 hour version basically no knowledge of coding and very little knowledge about design was required. The "8-9 hours of work" version required some understanding of coding. The final version is the best I can do in a reasonable time frame.  The AI used was `01-preview` from OpenAI. 

See if you can spot the differences between versions!

## The final version (After â‰ˆ14 hours of work)

https://rytilahti-juuso.github.io/meet-the-researcher/index.html

- A lot of final polishing done by hand.
- Problems with hallucination started to occur roughly after 1000 lines.
- Wanted this to be copy-pastable as plain html, so that added complexity.

## After 8-9 hours of work

https://rytilahti-juuso.github.io/meet-the-researcher/8-9-hours-version.html

- Mostly AI-made code, minor adjustements done by AI.
- Presentable and could be used as is

## After 6 hours of work

- All major features done by AI
- Minor adjustements to css (e.g. animation timing) done by human.
